# üíªOOP-Mini-Project
For this project, we created a simple code demonstration of a **Library Management System**.

# üìÑProject Description
In this system there are 3 main users: **Student, Staff and Librarian**. Student and Staff are categoried as Member that can **check account status, search, borrow, return and view all books**. The Librarian serve as the admin who manages tasks such as **add book, remove book, check book availability, edit book, view all book, check member details and view all member details**. The key feature that separates Student and Teacher are their **ID** and the **limit of book they can borrow, which are 3 and 5 respectively**. 

The Library Management System serves as a centralized platform for Student, Staff and Librarian to effectively manage their respective tasks and responsibilities.

Below is a **UML Class Diagram** that shows the relationship between different classes in the Library Management System.

# üí°How each topic (Ch5-Ch9) is implemented

# Chapter 5: ArrayList/Vector
ArrayList used for:
  1. Storing collection of books (ArrayList<Book>)
  2. Managing registered members (ArrayList<Member>)
  3. HashMap used for tracking borrow records (HashMap<String, BorrowRecord>)

Operations used:
  1. add()/remove() for book management

# Chapter 6: Class Relationships
Association:
  1. Library has Books 
  2. Library has Members 

Aggregation:
  1. Librarian manages Books 

Composition:
  1. BorrowRecord composed of Member and Book 

# Chapter 7: Inheritance
Member
  1. extends StudentMember
  2. extends StaffMember

Key differences:
  Students: 3 book limit, 14-day loan period
  Staff: 5 book limit, 28-day loan period

Abstract methods in Member:
  1. getMemberType()
  2. getMaxBooks()
  3. getLoanPeriodDays()

# Chapter 8: Polymorphism
Method overriding:
  1. Different implementations of getMemberType() in subclasses
  2. Custom toString() methods throughout
  3. Dynamic method invocation in borrowing/returning operations

# Chapter 9: Exception Handling

Exception handling for:
  1. Invalid user input
  2. Book availability checks
  3. Member borrowing limits
  4. Removing non-existent books
  5. Try-catch blocks in all user interaction points
