# üíªOOP-Mini-Project
For this project, we created a simple code demonstration of a **Library Management System**. The project details are fully documented in the next section.

# üìÑProject Description
In this system there are 3 main users: **Student, Staff and Librarian**. Student and Staff are categoried as Member that can **check account status, search, borrow, return and view all books**. The Librarian serve as the admin who manages tasks such as **add book, remove book, check book availability, edit book, view all book, check member details and view all member details**. The key feature that separates Student and Teacher are their **ID** and the **limit of book they can borrow, which are 3 and 5 respectively**. 

The Library Management System serves as a centralized platform for Student, Staff and Librarian to effectively manage their respective tasks and responsibilities.

# üìòOverview of UML Class Diagram
![UML Class Diagram](./images/UML%20Class%20Diagram.png)<br>
The Library Management System is divided into several classes: **LibraryManagementSystem, Members(Student and Staff), Library, Book and BorrowRecord.** The relationships between these classes determine how they interact within the system. Each class functions and tasks will be explained in great detail in the following section.

# üîóClasses and Their Responsibilities
**1. LibraryManagementSystem**
- This is the main class that contains the Library instance and handles user interaction.
- Coordinate the flow between user input and library functionalities.
- It includes methods for menus and operations like adding books, borrowing/returning books, and searching.

**2. Library**
- Represents the model in MVC architecture, managing the core logic of the system.
- Attributes: name, address, books (a list of Book), members (a list of Member), and borrowRecords (a map from book ID to list of borrow records).
- Key Methods:
  - addBook(), removeBook(), borrowBook(), returnBook() for managing library items.
  - registerMember() and findMember() to manage users.
  - displayAllBooks() and displayLibraryStatus() for status reports.

**3. Book**
- Represents a book in the library.
- Attributes: id, title, author, year, totalCopies, availableCopies.
- Methods: Getters and setters, and utility functions for managing book copies.

**4. Member (Abstract Class)**
- Represents the superclass for all members (students and staff).
- Attributes: id, name, email.
- Abstract Methods:
  - getMaxBooks() and getLoanPeriodDays() define limits and duration depending on member type.
  - borrowBook() and returnBook() for handling loans.
  - Two subclasses:
    - StudentMember (adds faculty)
    - StaffMember (adds department)

**5. StudentMember / StaffMember**
- Inherit from Member and implement the abstract methods.
- Define different borrowing limits and loan periods.

**6. BorrowRecord**
- Represents a borrowing transaction.
- Attributes: member, book, borrowDate, dueDate.
- Used for: Tracking who borrowed what and when.

# üß†Key Object Oriented Programming Concept Used in UML Class Diagram<br>
- **Inheritance:** StudentMember and StaffMember inherit from the abstract Member class.<br>
- **Abstraction:** Abstract class. Member defines the overall behaviour for all member kinds.<br>
- **Encapsulation:** Private fields with public getters and setters.<br>
- **Polymorphism:** Library employs Member references that can refer to either a StudentMember or a StaffMember.

# üí°How each topic (Ch5-Ch9) is implemented

# Chapter 5: ArrayList/Vector
ArrayList used for:
  1. Storing collection of books (ArrayList<Book>)
  2. Managing registered members (ArrayList<Member>)
  3. HashMap used for tracking borrow records (HashMap<String, BorrowRecord>)

Operations used:
  1. add()/remove() for book management

# Chapter 6: Class Relationships
Association:
  1. Library has Books 
  2. Library has Members 

Aggregation:
  1. Librarian manages Books 

Composition:
  1. BorrowRecord composed of Member and Book 

# Chapter 7: Inheritance
Member
  1. extends StudentMember
  2. extends StaffMember

Key differences:
  Students: 3 book limit, 14-day loan period
  Staff: 5 book limit, 28-day loan period

Abstract methods in Member:
  1. getMemberType()
  2. getMaxBooks()
  3. getLoanPeriodDays()

# Chapter 8: Polymorphism
Method overriding:
  1. Different implementations of getMemberType() in subclasses
  2. Custom toString() methods throughout
  3. Dynamic method invocation in borrowing/returning operations

# Chapter 9: Exception Handling

Exception handling for:
  1. Invalid user input
  2. Book availability checks
  3. Member borrowing limits
  4. Removing non-existent books
  5. Try-catch blocks in all user interaction points

**3d(i). Borrow Book**<br>
![Borrow Book](./images/Borrow%20Book.png)

**3d(ii). Borrow Book Limit**<br>
**Since the limit of book allowed to be borrowed by a student member is 3, if a student try to borrow more than 3 books, below message will be shown. This same logic applies for staff member too except the limit is 5 instead.**<br>
![Student Book Limit Reached](./images/Book%20Limit%20Reached.png)

**Same goes for staff member except the limit is 5, if a staff try to borrow more than 5 below message will be shown.**

**3e. Return Book**<br>
